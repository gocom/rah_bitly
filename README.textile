h1. rah_bitly

p. Give "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com's articles tiny "Bitly":http://bitly.com powered short links. The links are generated automatically when an article is published and stored in a custom field of your choosing. Easy to setup, just define your credentials via graphical user interface. Adds zero more steps to article publishing.

h2. List of features

* Automatically generate shortened links for articles using "Bitly":http://bit.ly service.
* Easy to set up, easy to use.

h2. Requirements

p. Rah_bitly's minimum requirements:

* Textpattern CMS v4.5.0 or newer.
* PHP5 or newer.
** "cURL":http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php library or "allow_url_fopen":http://php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php set to true.
* Installed web server with internet connection and outgoing HTTP connections allowed.
* "Bitly":http://bit.ly account.
* End user: a modern web browser with JavaScript support.

Most servers, including shared hosting spaces, should be able to run *rah_bitly* just fine as long as Textpattern v4.5.0 or newer is installed.

h2. Installation

p. The usual plugin installation method is used by rah_bitly.

# Download, and copy and paste the plugin code to the _Install plugin_ field found in your Textpattern installation's _Plugins_ interface (TXP / Admin / Plugins).
# Start the automated setup process by clicking the _Upload_ button next to the field.
# After the initial setup is done, active the plugin. Look for rah_bitly in the list of plugins and click the row's _Active_ column's link to active.

h2. Configuring

p. To start using rah_bitly you will first need to define your _Bitly login_,  _API key_ and the "custom field":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=custom_field you want to use to store shortened links.

p. Setting the preferences is easy. You can find all you need in Textpattern's "Advanced Preferences":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences (TXP/Admin/Preferences/Admin), neatly organized under _Bitly integration_ section. Following three options will be present.

* *Bitly login* is where your login id to "Bitly":http://bit.ly service would go.
* *API key* is your API key. You can find your API key from your Bitly account's settings page.
* *Store in custom field* is the custom field that will be used to store shortened links.

h2. Generating links

p. Bitly links are generated for an article when one of the three conditions is met.

* When the article is published.
* When already published article's URL title is modified.
* When the custom field used to store the link is emptied.

p. All three conditions only apply while the article is in, or is saved with, _live_ or _sticky_ status. Short links won't be generated for unpublished articles.

p. All generated links will follow your Bitly account's preferences, including your custom domain or preferred domain.

p. If requesting a short link from Bitly fails due to connection error, or because Bitly's servers are temporarily unreachable, a new request is sent when the article is saved again. You will notice if the request has been successful when there is a shortened link in the custom field.

p. The link that the plugin will shorten is the article's permanent link, the real location of the individual article page that Textpattern responds to. It's the same location as where the _View_ link points on admin-side _Write_ and _Articles_ tabs.

h2. Displaying links

p. Displaying Bitly links on your page templates and articles is easy and customizable due to the fact that a "custom field":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=custom_field is used to store the shortened links.

bc. <txp:if_custom_field name="short_url">
	<a href="<txp:custom_field name="short_url" />">
		<txp:custom_field name="short_url" />
	</a>
<txp:else />
	No short link.
</txp:if_custom_field>

p. The above snippet would display shortened Bitly link when placed to article "form":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Forms or "context":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Textpattern:_Context_In_Depth. When no link is available _"No short link"_ message is shown. The @short_url@ is the name of the custom field.
